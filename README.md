# Predicting Disaster Tweets


Build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. 

The dataset has been acquired from the Kaggel Competition [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:

    The text of a tweet
    A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank)
    The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)
